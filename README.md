# La Casona
It's an informative website project built on Angular-Bootstrap frameworks using webpack and Babel to include ECMAScript 6 code.

#Starting using npm and webpack

Ensure that you have installed Node.js. So you will be able to use CLI to install all modules required to use this template.
Open your command console on the folder of the project where Package.json is located and just write "npm install". This will install all dependencies on the folder "node_modules".

Once all is installed, on console write "npm start", that command will start the webpack dev server, and will open a new browser/window tab of the project.

If you have already copied /app folder, you are ready to start working on your project!

#Issues
Actually I'm still working on importing custom css files.
Once finished I'll update all branch with latest updates.
